I'm a bit of an odd case here, as I'm starting onboarding in 2 days so I don't know what my company (crowdstrike) has set up for my team regarding data analytics support. I can imagine using this on top of a data schema at my last company (Mapbox) to help sectionalize and build data tools for our sales and strategy teams as we did in the projects.  The value here is the repeatability and set and forget nature. We could have set dbt runs and have our excel models and tableau vizs run directly off of that. As a small team, we could abuse the tests to check our work and send out perfect models with nearly 0 work once it's set up. This is really appealing, as we were dragging in data sources and making our excel much more complicated trying to transform the data there, rather than transforming it beforehand

I just finished my college-graduation job search. I knew where I wanted to end up, and generally the path to get there was a more analytically heavy route.  I wanted to end up as a strategy analyst with data chops.  the role I took is much more of a strategic role than an analyst, however knowing debt, freshening up on my SQL skills, and learning a data pipeline are extremely helpful to contextualize data asks for the future. I'll be able to lean over and help out with data issues for my team while understanding the ingestion goals
